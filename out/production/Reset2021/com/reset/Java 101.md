### The class

```
class sometihgSometinhg {
    public static void main(Strig[] args) {
        System.out.println("Print me like one of your French girls.");
    }
}
```

The `class` statement defines the creation of a class( :thumbsup: ).

> class is Javaâ€™s basic unit of encapsulation

`Somethingsomething` is the name of this class. And naming a class follows the camelCase convention, meaning that 
the first word comes i small case and the following words start with capital letters. Curly braces open and close the 
code blocks of a class definition.

`public static void main(Strig[] args)`
